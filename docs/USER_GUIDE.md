## Understanding Match Scores

### Score Ranges

- **85-100**: Strong Match - High confidence this is the correct pharmacy
- **60-84**: Weak Match - Possible match, requires manual review
- **0-59**: No Match - Likely different pharmacy

### Score Components

Each score has two parts:
1. **Street Score (70% weight)**: How well street addresses match
2. **City/State/ZIP Score (30% weight)**: How well locations match

Example interpretations:
- Street: 95, City: 100 = Same address (strong match)
- Street: 95, City: 0 = Same street, different city (weak match)
- Street: 30, City: 50 = Completely different address (no match)

## Validation Process

### When to Validate

Validate results when:
- Reviewing weak matches (60-84 scores)
- Confirming critical licenses
- Overriding automatic scoring
- Creating audit trail for compliance

### How to Validate

1. **Review the Details**
   - Compare pharmacy address vs. license address
   - Check license status and expiration
   - View screenshots for additional context

2. **Make a Decision**
   - **Verified Present**: Confirm pharmacy has valid license
   - **Verified Empty**: Confirm no license exists
   - **Skip**: Leave unvalidated for now

3. **Document Reason**
   - Add explanation for decision
   - Reference specific evidence
   - Note any discrepancies

### Validation Best Practices

- Always check screenshots when scores are 60-84
- Look for name variations (LLC, Inc., DBA)
- Verify expiration dates are current
- Document suite/unit number differences
- Flag addresses that need updating

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match
- Score: 95+
- Same address, active license
- Action: Generally no validation needed

### Scenario 2: Name Variation
- Score: 60-84
- "Pharmacy LLC" vs "Pharmacy Inc"
- Action: Review screenshots, validate if same entity

### Scenario 3: Address Change
- Score: 40-60
- Old address in system
- Action: Validate and note address update needed

### Scenario 4: No Results Found
- Status: No Data
- State board returned no results
- Action: Validate as empty if confirmed

### Scenario 5: Multiple Licenses
- Multiple results for same pharmacy
- Different license types or locations
- Action: Review each, validate primary license
