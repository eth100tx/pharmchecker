# PharmChecker Scoring System Review Plan

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive plan for reviewing and potentially refactoring the PharmChecker scoring system. The goal is to ensure there is a single, well-defined entry point for lazy scoring and that it's being called in the right places with proper error handling and performance optimization.

## Current Status Summary
- ✅ **Lazy Scoring Implemented**: Scores computed on-demand, not during import
- ✅ **Working System**: 96.5% accuracy for perfect matches in system tests
- ⚠️ **Multiple Entry Points**: Potential inconsistency in how scoring is triggered
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: May need review for robustness
- ⚠️ **Performance**: Batch sizes and caching strategy may need optimization

## Key Problems to Investigate

### 1. Entry Point Consolidation
**Problem**: Multiple ways to trigger scoring may lead to inconsistency
- `ScoringEngine.compute_scores()` - Direct manual scoring
- `ScoringEngine.compute_scores_if_missing()` - Conditional lazy scoring
- Various GUI integration points
- CLI/development entry points

**Goal**: Single, standardized entry point with consistent behavior

### 2. Call Site Analysis
**Problem**: Scoring may be triggered from multiple locations inconsistently
- GUI: `utils/database.py` in `get_results_matrix()`
- System tests: Direct ScoringEngine calls
- Development tools: Manual CLI usage
- Potential API endpoints

**Goal**: Identify all call sites and standardize approach

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
**Problem**: Unclear how system behaves when scoring fails
- Database connection issues during scoring
- Algorithm failures on malformed data
- Partial scoring completion
- User experience during long scoring operations

**Goal**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation

### 4. Performance & Scalability
**Problem**: Current batch sizes and caching may not be optimal
- Batch size of 200 may not be optimal for all datasets
- No progress indication for long-running operations
- Memory usage during large scoring operations
- Database connection management

**Goal**: Optimized performance for various dataset sizes

## Specific Review Areas

### Entry Point Analysis
**Current Entry Points:**
```python
# Primary lazy entry point (CANDIDATE FOR STANDARDIZATION)
ScoringEngine.compute_scores_if_missing(states_tag, pharmacies_tag)

# Direct scoring (MANUAL/DEVELOPMENT USE)
ScoringEngine.compute_scores(states_tag, pharmacies_tag)

# GUI integration (MAY NEED CONSOLIDATION)
DatabaseManager.get_results_matrix() → automatic scoring trigger
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Is `compute_scores_if_missing()` the right single entry point?
2. Should GUI integration call this method directly or through another layer?
3. How should manual/development scoring work relative to the main entry point?
4. What about batch/CLI scoring operations?

### Call Site Mapping
**Known Call Sites:**
1. **`utils/database.py:get_results_matrix()`** - Automatic GUI triggering
2. **`system_test.py`** - Direct ScoringEngine instantiation
3. **Development/CLI** - Manual scoring commands
4. **Future API endpoints** - Programmatic access

**Analysis Needed:**
- Trace all actual calls to scoring functionality
- Identify inconsistencies in error handling
- Check parameter passing and validation
- Verify transaction handling and rollback scenarios

### Performance Profiling Areas
**Current Configuration:**
- Batch size: 200 pharmacy-result pairs
- No explicit timeout handling
- No progress indication for long operations
- Database connection per ScoringEngine instance

**Metrics to Measure:**
- Scoring throughput (pairs/second) for various dataset sizes
- Memory usage during large operations
- Database connection efficiency
- User experience during scoring delays

### Error Scenarios to Test
**Database Issues:**
- Connection failures during scoring
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Partial batch completion
- Database lock/timeout conditions

**Data Issues:**
- Malformed address data
- Missing pharmacy/result records
- Algorithm failures on edge cases
- Invalid dataset tag combinations

**System Issues:**
- Memory constraints during large operations
- Concurrent scoring operations
- Long-running operation cancellation
- System restart during active scoring

                     progress_callback=None, timeout=None) -> ScoringResult:
        """Single entry point for all scoring operations"""
        pass
```

### Consistent Call Pattern
```python
# ALL CALLERS USE SAME PATTERN
from imports.scoring import ScoringManager

with ScoringManager() as scorer:
    result = scorer.ensure_scores(states_tag, pharmacies_tag, 
                                progress_callback=update_progress)
