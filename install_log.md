# PharmChecker Installation Log

## Setup Started: 2025-08-11

### Prerequisites ✅
- Python 3.8+ available 
- PostgreSQL 13+ available
- .env file already configured for local PostgreSQL (database: ptest, user: postgres)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Installing Python Dependencies ✅
- All dependencies already satisfied in virtual environment
- No installation issues

#### 2. Database Architecture Migration ✅
- Found that system had been simplified to use `get_all_results_with_context()` instead of legacy `get_results_matrix()` and `find_missing_scores()`
- Updated setup.py verification to check for new function
- Updated system_test.py to use new comprehensive results with client-side aggregation 
- Updated scoring engine (scoring.py) to work with new architecture

#### 3. Database Setup ✅ 
- Setup script ran successfully
- Database 'ptest' created
- All tables created successfully
- Functions installed (get_all_results_with_context)
- Admin user created
- All verification tests passed

#### 4. System Testing ✅
- End-to-end system test completed successfully
- All 6 steps passed:
  ✅ Clean existing test data
  ✅ Import pharmacy data (3 test pharmacies)
  ✅ Import state search data (5 search results) 
  ✅ Query initial results (6 combinations, 6 without scores)
  ✅ Run scoring engine (4 scores computed)
  ✅ Query final results (proper status distribution)

#### 5. MCP Database Access ✅
- MCP connection to postgres-prod working
- Can query all tables and functions
- Test data visible and accessible
- Comprehensive results function working correctly

### Final Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**All systems operational:**
- Database infrastructure ✅
- Import system ✅  
- Scoring engine ✅
- Comprehensive results system ✅
- MCP integration ✅
- System tests passing ✅

### Key Architecture Changes Made
1. **Function Migration**: Updated all code to use `get_all_results_with_context()` instead of legacy aggregated functions
2. **Client-Side Aggregation**: Added aggregation helper functions for backward compatibility
3. **Scoring Engine**: Modified to work with comprehensive results instead of dedicated functions
4. **Test System**: Updated system tests to work with new architecture

### Ready for Use
- System is production-ready
- All core functionality working
- MCP access configured and tested
- Ready for data imports and GUI usage
